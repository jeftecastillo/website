	 <p> Banksy created a blog where people can follow his every move while he is in New York. After he was done with the street exhibition piece, he will post it and give people an adress. People will go and see art pieces done by him self. This was one of the first piece that he created when he had arrived. Two boys trying to reach for a spray can with a sign that says <strong>"graffiti is a crime".</strong></p>

	 <p> “<i>Hammer Boy</i>” depicts a child playing the  high striker or strongman game commonly found at carnivals. We have all tried to be the strongest child at a carnival in order to win the biggest teddy bear as prize. Banksy painted this young little boy hammering a fire hydrant which the water will ring the red bell on the top. This was one of the piece that a lot of people took pictures of and could relate to.  </p>

	 <p>After a few stencils around New York, people came across with the Snoopy character and how it relate to the people who work hard with their 9 to 5 jobs. As a New Yorker, you might be doing the same routine and almost getting tired of it. Waking up early in the morning and the only thing you can think of is getting home to sleep on your comfortable bed.  </p>

	 <p>Banksy left this endearing robot spray-painting a barcode on a wall at Stillwell and Neptune. If you’re wondering about the significance of the number, it’s a nucleotide sequence for homo sapiens, according to Street Art News. </p>

	 <p> The famous rat painting that is on canal street as you are heading to Soho, has been around for many years. When Banky came to New York, he painted this buffer guy who were painting over the big rat on the side of the building. As we all know, buffing has been a big major role in New York City as they are trying to eliminate graffiti and not let these young taggers shine.   </p>

	 <p>This wall was one of the most recognizeable piece because of the stencil balloon that he painted. Everyone was wondering about the little girl that should of been painted in this piece but he wanted it to be interacted with the audience. Some other New York writer tagged along the side of the balloon because of it was getting to many exposure. Many people were upset because they did that, this wall made it to news. Where is Banksy?   </p>

	 <p>Even though this wall piece was not in New york, I want you guys to see how creative a street artist can be. The painting portrays the late steve jobs wearing his trademark turtle neck and jeans with an early personal computer in one hand and a sack of stuff slung over his shoulder in the other. The message in the mural is clear. People who want to ban refugees from entering their country could be depriving the world of the next Steve Jobs, who was himself the song of a Syrian immagrant. This remind me of all the politician that is happening now with Trump not wanting immigrants to come to the United States and wants to build a wall. This is a strong image, espicially because we know how mac has evolutionized through out the years. </p>

	 <p> We all know the infamous iconic I HEART NY and how impactful that design is but what is Banksy trying to tell us? Known for politcally charged art and use of sarcasm, many area onlookers claim that the doctor depicted in the piece is searching for the pulse of a city whose heart was one beating strongly and proudly. bu no longer.  </p>

	 <p>The silhoutte of the dog and the hydrant was a very strong visual. Does it mean that the dog is marking is teritory by peeing on the hydrant? or does it means thatis relating to real life situations when you take your dog or puppy for a walk? This was one of the most hatest piece in New York. Street graffiti artist tagged all over this art piece because they didnt like the attention that he had on the audience. A graffiti artist never likes when another street artist comes to their teritory.</p>

  <div class="ten">

	 <p>The image itself featuring a small, dark skinned boy of indeterminate ethnicity taggin a wall while being served by a white butler would seem to subvert the idea of street artist (particularly one of color)as crimininal and place them in the realm of the gentry. According to people reactions, the image is drawing negative attention from locals, who feel that it perpeturates negative stereotypes about people of color. Some people who live in the Bronx, actually said that when someone talks about their neighborhood, they think it's a ghetto borough. Every artist creates their own meaning in their head. </p>
